## What is this?

This is a collection of my work during a month'ish long period where I started to take up Python. It contains the course assignments, a few EulerProject problems and random files where I'm playing around with funcional Python coding.

## Purpose

There is no purpose really. I've just started to pick up Python and this is just stuff that I'm trying
out. The code will act as a bank of knowledge for me when I start the Python course at the end of
November 2018. The course is @ Reykjavik University and is labeled SC-T-308-PRLA.

## SC-T-308-PRLA

The 3rd and final project was worked in collaboration with another student so it's in a diffrent repository.
