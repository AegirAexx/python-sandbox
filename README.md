## Purpose

There is no purpose really. I've just started to pick up Python and this is just stuff that I'm trying
out. The code will act as a bank of knowledge for me when I start the Python course at the end of
November 2018. The course is @ Reykjavik University and is labeled SC-T-308-PRLA.

## SC-T-308-PRLA

I plan to put all of the progamming projects here that will be assigned during the course.

The course took place between November 26th and December 14th 2018.

## General thoughts about Python

As it turns out I really like Python.

I started out with C++ during the fall 2017 semester and soon there after fell in love with programming. I really love to solve problems and that is what the discipline is all about so that was a match made in heaven. I went all in and read everything I could about the language when I was not actually coding something. I got high grades in the course and loved every minute of it.

After that I really got into JavaScript and web technologies. Back in the day, during the early years of the Internet I learned how to write HTML and CSS but never to actually program. So when I took a web design course I really went deep into JavaScript. After becoming good with C++ picking up JavaScript was a simple task. The dynamic aspects of the language was thrilling to me, kind of what the wild west was to many people in the early 20th century. You could basically get away with murder.
