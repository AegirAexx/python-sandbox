# Python Sandbox | SC-T-308-PRLA

## Purpose

There is no purpose really. I've just started to pick up Python and this is just stuff that I'm trying
out. The code will act as a bank of knowledge for me when I start the Python course at the end of
November 2018. The course is @ Reykjavik University and is labeled SC-T-308-PRLA.

## SC-T-308-PRLA

I plan to put all of the progamming projects here that will be assigned during the course.

The course took place between November 26th and December 14th 2018.
